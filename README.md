## A passionate beginner Web Developer.

I'm currently learning full-stack development and building real projects to improve my skills.
I love creating clean UI, smooth animations, and practical web apps.
I believe in learning by building — so I create projects, fix bugs, and experiment a lot!

## What I'm Learning Right Now
- React.js (Components, hooks, routing)
- Node.js + Express (Backend basics)
- MongoDB (Storing data)
-Improving JavaScript logic & real-world projects

## Here are some things I’m working on:
React Projects
Project A – A simple React web app to practice components & state
Project B – A small tool / utility built with JS
(I’ll keep adding more as I learn!)

## Tech Stack
Frontend:
HTML • CSS • JavaScript • React • TailwindCSS
Backend:
Node.js • Express • MongoDB
Tools:

## Goals for 2025
Build 10+ projects
